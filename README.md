👋 Hello there! I'm zenryui, a 21-year-old aspiring full-stack developer and web designer with a
   passion for crafting compelling user experiences. My expertise extends from coding dynamic
   web applications to designing intuitive user interfaces.

🎨 As a web designer, I utilize Alight Motion to bring my website designs to life, focusing on
   creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that resonate with users.

💻 When it comes to hardware, I'm an avid PC builder with a special interest in AMD, particularly
   the Ryzen lineup. Building and optimizing systems is not just a hobby for me; it's a blend of
   passion and craftsmanship.

🛠️ In the realm of web development, my toolbox includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for crafting
   interactive front-end experiences. On the back end, I work with PHP and MySQL to build scalable
   and efficient server-side solutions. Bootstrap is my go-to framework for creating responsive
   designs that adapt beautifully to various devices.

📱 If you'd like to see more of my work or connect with me, you can find me on Instagram at
   @zenryuiux. My pronouns are He/Him. Let's collaborate, innovate, and build awesome projects
   together!
